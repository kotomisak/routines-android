# Starter template

Use mobile-template in case you want to start with an app quickly.
Don't write boilerplate, and use following advantages of template:

 - It is connected to basic set of core modules (You don't have to setup Dagger and base classes again).
 - It's always ready for the newest versions of libraries
 - It has default extras content for the app
