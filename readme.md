Monorepo with useful Android constructs (available/reusable as separated modules).  

More about Monorepo idea is here https://jenicek.dev/2020/01/31/monorepo/     

More about my [code conventions](code-conventions.md) is here

# 0. Steps to build (run) any app here  
Practical guide first:

- Use the latest beta Android Studio version
- In proper mobile-appname directory, copy files from folder **extras/appname_sample** to folder **extras/appname** 
- In proper mobile-appname directory, rename files in **extras/appname** folder to have names just as this: **appname.properties** / **appname.jks**

# 2. Structure
This project contains apps and modules.   
It does not matter which architecture (MVVM/MVI/...) is used for it.  
Modules should be reusable across any available app.  
Every app/module should have it's own README.MD to describes detailed info about it (and it's usage).  


## 2.1 Extras
Is a set of supporting directories for every app
### graphics
Simple graphics (prepared by Gimp) to be used as base for launcher icon or banner for playstore.  
### keystore_sample
Sample keystore with sample keystore content to be quickly used as development keystore for the project.
